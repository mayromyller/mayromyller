## Hi there, I'm Mayro Myller ðŸ‘‹

### I'm a software developer in Brazil!

Currently, I work as a mobile developer both in Brazil and abroad, developing for agencies.

I work on front-end solutions with modern Javascript libraries with ReactJS and React Native. I also love researching and learning about Typescript, UI/UX, software architecture, best practices, and other subjects.

Call me to chat, it will be a pleasure to exchange experiences and ideas. Thanks!
